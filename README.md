<h2>Project Overview</h2>

**!DISCLAIMER! This is a cybersecurity project done for educational purposes so please do use it sensibly**

This project uses   Python and chromedriver with Selenium to create an Instagram bot that:

-Logins in automatically with the username and password supplied.

-Directs us to a specific account - in our case Neymarjr.

-scrapes his data : followers, likes, posts into an excel file sheet.

This bot is powerful and can be scaled to even do other functions such as Auto-liking pictures with specific hashtags; sending automated messages with every new follower, etc.
